We're not going to do this by trading one single trading strategy, even if it's a really good one. There just isn't a single trading strategy that will achieve this, at least not for any significant amount of time. If a single strategy does look like this for a year or two, it usually has something really ugly under the hood. I'm talking about ticking time bomb strategies, things like Forex, Martingale, things that look really great until they don't. Now, that's a topic for another video.

And more specifically, they build what we call an ensemble portfolio. This is the real holy grail, in my opinion. Let me show you how this is done in the real world. Now, here you can see two trading systems simulated over the past three and a half years. Strategy A is the blue line and strategy B is the red line. Which one of these is better?

I'm sure you can understand that, but if you do want to know exactly what the strategy is, I'm going to tell you at the end of the video, how to access it. Now, aside from having a clearly more stable equity curve, when you look at the chart, you can also see the other metrics here. The Marr ratio is significantly higher. By the way, Marr ratio just simply means the, it's the annualized return divided by the max drawdown. So the higher this number, the better the sharp is also significantly better. And the volatility is much lower. Now, again, the point of this video is not to confuse you with any math or anything, but the point is, you can see that now that we have a smoother return with less volatility, now we have a strategy we can scale. And the average capital required of each of these trades is actually way smaller than the capital we're allocating. So what if we just add size, right? You can see",

    "transcriptWindow": "one more trading day to really drive this home. You can see this day started out by firing our zero DTE range trade again, but with much better success this time, as you can see, it did turn out to be a very choppy and mean reverting day. Now, the idea of the ensemble portfolio system goes beyond just running multiple systems, right? You can actually practice this ensemble approach within each system itself. And you can see this by looking at our zero DTE green day system. This green day strategy didn't just take one shot. In fact, it entered in tranches scaling into the move throughout the day and diversifying by entry time to spread out our risk and remove timing from the equation. So not only can you diversify by strategy, you can also diversify by time within a strategy itself. And you can clearly see this with green day, how one entry stopped out on this down move, but green day overall made money on this day. All right, cool. So we have an ensemble portfolio of trading systems working beautifully, but there's another problem",
